                <h2>About me</h2>

                <p>
                    My name is Skorri Júlíusson. I am 23 years old and born and raised in Reykjavík, Iceland. I went to Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík, studied physiscs and mathematics as core course of study, and graduated in 2012. After graduation I worked at Fellaskóli, an elementary school in Breiðholt, as a leisure consultant. It was a challenging job where I was somtimes responsible for 40 children, most of which were either screaming from the top of their lungs or running around like baboons. I worked there for one semester, saving for a trip to South and Central America that was comming up the following year.
    <br/>In the early spring of 2013 I went to Venezuela to study spanish and work as a volunteer at the Parque Zoológico Chorros de Milla zoo. I stayed in Venezuela for six weeks and then traveled by bus for two months throughout Central America, from Panama to Mexico.
    <br/>In the fall of 2013 I started my studies at Reykjavík's University in discrete mathematics and computer science. I am currently studying as an exchange student at Danmarks Tekniske Universitet in Copenhagen where I am taking the last semester. After three years of studying I am graduating as a bachelor of science in discrete mathematics and computer science the 18th of June 2016.
