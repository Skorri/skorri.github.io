                <h2>About me</h2>

                <p>
                    My name is Skorri Júlíusson. I am 23 years old and born and raised in Reykjavík, Iceland. I went to Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík, studied physiscs and mathematics as core courses of study, and graduated in 2012. After graduation I worked at Fellaskóli, an elementary school in Breiðholt, as a leisure consultant. It was a challenging job where I was sometimes responsible for 40 children, that were most of the time either screaming from the top of their lungs or running around like baboons. I worked there for one semester, saving for a trip to South and Central America that was comming up the following year.</p>
    <p class="indent">
    In the early spring of 2013 I went to Venezuela to study Spanish and work as a volunteer at the Chorros de Milla zoo. I stayed in Venezuela for six weeks and then travelled by bus for two months throughout Central America, from Panama to Mexico.</p>
    <p class="indent">
    In the fall of 2013 I started my studies at Reykjavík's University in discrete mathematics and computer science. I am currently studying as an exchange student at Danmarks Tekniske Universitet in Copenhagen where I am taking the last semester. After three years of studying I am graduating as a bachelor of science in discrete mathematics and computer science the 18th of June 2016.
